# HOP-Streamlined
To use this tool you need to run HOP_Compare.py script. Then script will guide you through the process. 

As a result script will create two folder with .txt files inside them: 
  - Demo vs Scheme - evidence -----> in this directory you'll see files that show comparisson between Corvidae (demo page) and scheme page 
  - Generated evidence        -----> in this directory you'll see seperate files that contain text scraped from Crovidae (demo page) and scheme page
